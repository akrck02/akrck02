# Hi I'm akrck02 👋
Hi I'm a 25 year old software developer. I like puzzles, video games and software architecture.
From time to time I create projects to make development easier or solve problems. 

Project documentations are uploaded to my website.

> https://akrck02.org

I enjoy learning new programming languages and technologies while working on projects. 

## Currently 
These are the technologies I am working on right now:

> Ktor
> <br>Godot Engine

These are the languages I am learning right now:

> Kotlin
> <br>Go


## Some stats
Here you have some stats about my activity in Github so you can get to know me a little bit better!

## Open source, happy code.
I really love open source, I think it allows to learn and improve in development in an organic way and helps to form communities.
That's why most of my projects are licensed as open source. Feel free to contribute to the repositories if you find any of them interesting! 

## Support 
Doing open source often means spending time, effort and money to maintain and develop repositories full of libraries, apps, programs, APIs and other software.
That's why any support that can be received from the community is appreciated.
