# Hi I'm akrck02 ðŸ‘‹
Hi I'm a 21 year old software developer. I like puzzles, video games and software architecture.
From time to time I create projects to make development easier or solve problems. 

Project documentations are uploaded to my website.

## Open source, happy code.
I really love open source, I think it allows to learn and improve in development in an organic way and helps to form communities.
That's why most of my projects are licensed as open source. Feel free to contribute to the repositories if you find any of them interesting! 

## Support 
Doing open source often means spending time, effort and money to maintain and develop repositories full of libraries, apps, programs, APIs and other software.
That's why any support that can be received from the community, both intellectual and monetary, is appreciated.

I leave here places where you can support my work if you wish, thank you very much! :)
