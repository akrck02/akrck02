# Hi I'm akrck02 👋
Hi I'm a 25 year old software developer. I like puzzles, video games and software architecture.
From time to time I create projects to make development easier. 

Project documentations are uploaded to my website.

I enjoy learning new programming languages and technologies while working on projects. 

## Currently 
These are the technologies I am working on right now:

> Godot Engine
> <br>Compose multiplatform
> <br>GTD / BubbleUI

These are the languages I am learning right now:

> Go

## Open source.
I really love open source, I think it allows to learn and improve in development in an organic way and helps to form communities.
That's why most of my projects are licensed as open source. Feel free to contribute to the repositories if you find any of them interesting!
